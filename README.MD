## 🤝 My Learning Philosophy

> **"I learn by safely breaking things uwu"**

- 🎯 **Hands-on practice** over passive watching
- 🧩 **Solve challenges** before reading writeups
- 📝 **Document everything** (even mistakes!)
- 🌱 **Progress over perfection** - small wins matter
- 🤔 **Understand WHY** - not just copy-paste commands

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

**🔒 Ethics First:**
- All activities are **legal and authorized**
- I only hack **designated practice platforms**
- These skills are for **defensive security** and **learning**
- **Never** use these techniques on systems I don't own or have permission to test

**📚 Spoiler Warning:**
- Writeups contain **full solutions**
- Try challenges yourself **FIRST** before reading!
- Learning happens when you **struggle a bit** - it's okay! meow~
