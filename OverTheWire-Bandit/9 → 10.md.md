#### 🧩 Problem
The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt** in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.
#### ✅ Solution
```bash
ls -la
strings data.txt | grep ===
```

#### 📝 Notes
- This one we needed to use `strings` again but this time we attached `grep` via `|` in order to output the flag
- This works because it is telling it to output the string of text that precedes ===
