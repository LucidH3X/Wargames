#### 🧩 Problem
The password for the next level is stored in **/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14**. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. **Note:** **localhost** is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on


#### ✅ Solution
```bash
ls -la
exit
scp -P bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:sshkey.private .
ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

#### 📝 Notes
In this box we had to use *scp* to send a file to a remote host. We moved the sshkey from bandit 13 to 14 so we could log in.
