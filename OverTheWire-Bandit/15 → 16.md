#### 🧩 Problem
The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to **port 30001 on localhost** using SSL/TLS encryption.

#### ✅ Solution
```bash
openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001
```

This was pretty awkward we basically *openssl* into the client then sent the old password to get the new one. Not much to note outside reading the files provided on the site
