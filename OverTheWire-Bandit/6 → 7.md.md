The password for the next level is stored **somewhere on the server** and has all of the following properties:

- owned by user bandit7
- owned by group bandit6
- 33 bytes in size
#### ✅ Solution

find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33b
```

#### 📝 Notes
- We started with our normal `ls -la` after this we pulled up the internet to look at the find command again due to the fact that It looks like we are going to search for something this round again with different operators.
- The first one we run is `find / -user bandit7` this gives us all the files for that user.
- Next we add `-group` so narrow it down to the results from that group and user
- Then `-size` to narrow down the size to expose the password file
