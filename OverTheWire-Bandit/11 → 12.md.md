#### 🧩 Problem
The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt**, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions
#### ✅ Solution
```bash
ls -la
cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-Mn-m'
```

#### 📝 Notes
- This one was a bit odd I looked up `tr` to do this because it can translate the characters to a different one allowing us to recreate ROT13
- Then I paired it `cat` to post the data on the screen
- I did use a ROT13 key online to help me figure this out

#####  🕵️ Additional research  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13

`tr` is used to translate, this allows us to replace old characters with new ones . With this at hand we can do a [[ROT13]] which is rotating letters by 13
