#### 📝 Notes
 So on Level 1-2 I has some issues I ran into *-* for the first time. I have never seen this file type and when I ran `cat -` It froze up my shell. I had to pull open google to look into the issue and found that in cases that this pops up we need to run `cat ./-` to view the file so its specific otherwise it will search everything with *-*
