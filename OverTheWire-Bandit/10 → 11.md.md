#### 🧩 Problem
The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt**, which contains base64 encoded data

#### ✅ Solution
```bash
ls -la
strings data.txt | base64 -d
```

#### 📝 Notes
- Once again we are greeted by the *data.txt* file
- We hit the file with `strings` then `|` and the new command we learned today `base64 -d` which will decode the data that is  in the file so the output that is printed on the screen is readable
