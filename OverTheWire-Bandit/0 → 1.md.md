#### 🧩 Problem
The password for the next level is stored in a file called **readme** located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

#### ✅ Solution
```bash
ls          # List files
cat [file]  # Read file contents
```
