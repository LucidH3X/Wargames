#### 🧩 Problem
The password for the next level is stored in a file called `--spaces in this filename--` located in the home directory

#### ✅ Solution
```bash
cat -- "--spaces in this filename--"  # Files with spaces
```

#### 📝 Notes
 So this one was weird I ran into issues using `cat --spaces in this filename-- ` because when it sees `--` it thinks i'm trying to add a option to a output. So I check on `cat --help` and google and found that if I use `cat --` I can override this to say *"hey we are going ignore operators"*
