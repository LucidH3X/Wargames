#### 📝 Notes
- `ls -la`
-  We can see that there is a file called *data.txt* if we look at this file we can see hundreds of lines of text that is dupes of each other
- To solve this we had to learn about `sort` and `uniq` we used `--help` on each to find the operators we could use that would help narrow down the flag 
- We came across `uniq -u` that will only show the line that is unique and print it to the screen

#####  🕵️ Additional research

We learned that we can use `>` to print the output to a file rather then on the screen like `ls > myoutput` as well as we can append data using `>>` this will add the info to a existing file rather then replace it.

If we use `>` we can Redirect the data 

Piping is done using ` |`  this is used to send data to and from programs. *Run the first program and make sure it provides the output you were expecting. Then add the second program and check again before adding the third and so on. This will save you a lot of frustration.* `ls | grep data file -t > myoutput`
