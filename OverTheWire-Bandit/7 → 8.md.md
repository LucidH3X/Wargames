#### 📝 Notes
- `ls -la` to see if we need to worry about any hidden directories or files first
- First mistake we did was `cat data.txt` there was way to much info for us to go through. I had to wait it out then try again with a approach using`grep`
- So we went threw the `grep` help and found that we can do it by file name and a string *see command in solution* which returned the flag

#####  🕵️ Additional research  
https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-grep-command-to-search-files-in-linux/
We learned in out command search that we can look up both by *file* and by *string*. In other words we can refine the search to turn back just results int he file that are near the word we are looking for.
