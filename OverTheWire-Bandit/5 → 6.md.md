#### 🧩 Problem
The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under the **inhere** directory and has all of the following properties:

- human-readable
- 1033 bytes in size
- not executable


#### ✅ Solution
```bash
ls -la
find -type f -size 1033c
cat 
```

#### 📝 Notes
- First thing we did was `ls -la` to list all the directories  
- Then we `cd inhere` to move into the directory
- We the used `find --help` to get info on the find command
- We discovered we can search for a file type with `-type -f` and by size with `-size`
- The flag was now exposed and we had to `cat` into the file to see it

#####  🕵️ Additional research  
- `find --help` to learn the find command operators
- https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-find-files-in-linux-using-the-command-line/#find-files-by-size was used to find more info on the operators I can use
