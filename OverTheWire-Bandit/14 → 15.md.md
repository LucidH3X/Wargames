#### 🧩 Problem
The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to **port 30000 on localhost**.

#### ✅ Solution
```bash
ls -la
chmod 600 sshkey.private
ls -l sshkey.private

ls -la
cd /
```

#### 📝 Notes
So first thing I did was ls into the box. We can see we have a ssh key but don't have the perms to use it. We need to use *chmod* to change it over to give us access then we *ssh* back into the box. 

Like always once into the box we hit with `ls -la` we can see there is a _.ssh_ file.
but this has nothing. So its off to find the password, we move into the root directory with `cd /` then we move into _etc_ and then to a file called  *bandit pass* we can now see the password we pasted into the screen shot above.  
 
the next thing it tells us to do is submit it via local host we we run *nc* and receive the flag
