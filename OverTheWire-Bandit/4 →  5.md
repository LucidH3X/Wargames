#### 📝 Notes
- So I started this one with looking at the box with `ls -la` nothing came up so I used `la` I see that the folder was called *inhere* So I `cat` to the folder. Once in the directory I used `ls -la` To see all the files in the directory and found 48!
- I looked online how  we can list all the contents at once and found that `cat *` is the solution but this was weird to read due to the weird text that was showing up . So we had to shift into looking at them one by one. 
- We used `cat -- -` to look at each file one by one till we saw the flag

#####  🕵️ Additional research  
- I had to look up how to open all the files in a directory online. I found that using `cat *` I was able to show whats in all the files in the directory at once.
