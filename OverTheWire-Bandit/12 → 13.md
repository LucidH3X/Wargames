#### 🧩 Problem
The password for the next level is stored in the file **data.txt**, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work. Use mkdir with a hard to guess directory name. Or better, use the command “mktemp -d”. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)


#### ✅ Solution
```bash
ls -la
cd /tmp
mktemp -d
cd
cp ~/data.txt .
mv data.txt hexdump_data
cat hexdump_data | head
xxd -r hexdump_data compressed_data
ls
cat compressed_data | head

```

#### 📝 Notes
- This one was actually pretty hard I had to look over a walk though and move through it slowly to grasp it. I posted the guide bellow . Essentially  what you do is we keep compressing and decompressing the file to revel a deeper clue. Once we produce `data8` we see the key. This was the first one I needed to use a guide for, i'm kinda bummed but it was fun! having to do research on something out of my comfort zone and skill.

#####  🕵️ Additional research  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_dump [[Hex dump]]
`xxd` is used to create a Hex Dump file
`gzip` is used to compress or decompress a file
`bzip2` is the same as above
`tar` creates archive files
